My host family included me in their daily cooking right from the beginning, which gave me a hands on education in Mexican cooking techniques and culture. I'm a CPA by day, but an amateur chef by night. I'm excited to share my passion for cooking with you!"

  - explanation
    - "Pork is marinated in a combination of dried chiles, spices and pineapple. In some places achiote is also added, and then slowly cooked with a gas flame on a vertical rotisserie called a trompo (lit: spinning top), very similar to how shawarma is cooked, with a piece of fresh onion and a pineapple on top."
  - background/history
    - "Al pastor (from Spanish, In the style of the shepherd) is a dish developed in Central Mexico, likely as a result of the adoption of the shawarma spit-grilled meat brought by Lebanese immigrants to Mexico. Being derived from shawarma, it is also similar to the Turkish doner kebab and the Greek gyros. Whereas shawarma is usually lamb-based (thus the "shepherd style" name), gyros and tacos al pastor in Mexico are made from pork."
